This is a program to simulate a bank with multiple tellers. The goal 
of this simulation is to collect statistical information of the bank’s 
customers and tellers. A bank service area consists of several tellers and a 
customer waiting line (or queue). In each time unit, at most one new customer 
arrives at the waiting line. If the customer waiting line is too long, the 
customer leaves without completing transaction; otherwise, the customer gets 
into the waiting line. If all tellers are busy, customers in the waiting lines 
must wait to for a teller. If a teller is free and customers are waiting, the 
first customer in the waiting line advances to the teller’s counter and begins 
transaction.  When a customer is done, the customer departs and the teller 
becomes free. We will run the simulation through many units of time. At the 
end of each time unit the program prints out a "snap-shot" of queues, 
customers and tellers. At the end of the program, the program will print 
out statistics and conclude simulation.
